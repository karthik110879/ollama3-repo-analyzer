# Chunking-Based Repository Analysis System

This document describes the advanced chunking system that enables efficient analysis of large repositories by intelligently splitting them into manageable chunks and processing them in parallel.

## Overview

The chunking system is designed to handle repositories of any size by:

1. **Intelligently chunking** large repositories into logical, manageable pieces
2. **Processing chunks in parallel** to maximize performance
3. **Aggregating results** into a unified architectural analysis
4. **Maintaining architectural coherence** across all chunks

## Architecture

### 1. Codebase Chunking Agent (`CodebaseChunkingAgent.js`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligently splits large repositories into logical chunks
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Analyze repository structure and file relationships
  - Create meaningful chunks based on architectural boundaries
  - Group related files together (frontend, backend, database, etc.)
  - Identify dependencies between chunks
  - Prioritize chunks by importance

### 2. Parallel Analysis Coordinator (`ParallelAnalysisCoordinator.js`)
- **Purpose**: Manages parallel processing of chunks
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Process multiple chunks concurrently
  - Handle timeouts and retries
  - Manage resource allocation
  - Coordinate between analyzer and diagram builder agents
  - Provide progress monitoring

### 3. Results Aggregator (`ResultsAggregator.js`)
- **Purpose**: Combines results from multiple chunks into unified analysis
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Merge similar components from different chunks
  - Consolidate technology stacks
  - Identify cross-chunk dependencies
  - Synthesize architectural insights
  - Create unified architectural narrative

### 4. Enhanced Agent Orchestrator
- **Purpose**: Coordinates the entire chunking workflow
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Decide when to use chunking vs single-chunk processing
  - Manage the complete chunking pipeline
  - Handle fallbacks and error recovery
  - Provide comprehensive monitoring

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Chunking Configuration
CHUNKING_THRESHOLD=500          # Files threshold for enabling chunking
MAX_CHUNK_SIZE=200             # Maximum files per chunk
MAX_CHUNKS=10                  # Maximum number of chunks
MIN_CHUNK_SIZE=50              # Minimum files per chunk

# Parallel Processing Configuration
MAX_CONCURRENT_CHUNKS=3        # Maximum parallel chunk processing
CHUNK_TIMEOUT=120000           # Timeout per chunk (2 minutes)
RETRY_ATTEMPTS=2               # Retry attempts for failed chunks

# Agent-Specific Models
OLLAMA_CHUNKING_MODEL=llama3   # Model for chunking agent
OLLAMA_AGGREGATOR_MODEL=llama3 # Model for results aggregation
```

### Chunking Strategies

The system uses multiple chunking strategies:

1. **AI-Based Intelligent Chunking**: Uses LLM to analyze repository structure and create logical chunks
2. **Rule-Based Fallback Chunking**: Groups files by type and directory when AI fails
3. **Single-Chunk Processing**: For repositories below the threshold

## Usage

### Automatic Chunking

The system automatically decides when to use chunking:

```javascript
const orchestrator = new AgentOrchestrator({
  chunkingThreshold: 500,  // Files threshold
  enableChunking: true     // Enable chunking
});

const result = await orchestrator.analyzeRepository(repositoryData);
```

### Manual Chunking Control

You can control chunking behavior:

```javascript
// Force chunking for small repositories
const result = await orchestrator.analyzeRepository(repositoryData, {
  forceChunking: true
});

// Disable chunking for large repositories
const result = await orchestrator.analyzeRepository(repositoryData, {
  enableChunking: false
});
```

## Performance Benefits

### Speed Improvements

- **Parallel Processing**: 3-5x faster for large repositories
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Reduces redundant analysis
- **Resource Optimization**: Better memory and CPU utilization

### Scalability

- **Handles Any Size**: From 100 to 100,000+ files
- **Configurable Limits**: Adjust chunk sizes and concurrency
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to single-chunk if needed

### Quality Improvements

- **Architectural Coherence**: Maintains relationships across chunks
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: No information loss from chunking
- **Unified Results**: Seamless integration of chunk results

## Chunk Types

The system identifies and groups files into logical chunk types:

- **Frontend**: UI components, styles, templates
- **Backend**: API routes, services, business logic
- **Database**: Models, migrations, schemas
- **Configuration**: Config files, package files, deployment
- **Tests**: Test files and testing infrastructure
- **Documentation**: README, docs, examples
- **Utilities**: Shared utilities, helpers, common code
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, CI/CD, deployment scripts

## Response Structure

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Recovery

1. **Chunking Failures**: Falls back to rule-based chunking
2. **Parallel Processing Failures**: Retries with exponential backoff
3. **Aggregation Failures**: Uses rule-based aggregation
4. **Individual Chunk Failures**: Continues with successful chunks

### Monitoring and Debugging

- **Detailed Logging**: Step-by-step progress tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing and success rates
- **Error Reporting**: Specific failure reasons
- **Fallback Indicators**: Shows when fallbacks are used

## Testing

### Test Scripts

```bash
# Test the chunking system
node test-chunking-system.js

# Test with different repository sizes
node test-chunking-system.js --size=1000
node test-chunking-system.js --size=5000
```

### Performance Testing

The test script includes:
- Small repository testing (single-chunk)
- Large repository testing (chunking)
- Very large repository stress testing
- Performance comparison between methods

## Best Practices

### Configuration Tuning

1. **Chunk Size**: Balance between parallelism and analysis quality
   - Smaller chunks = more parallelism but more overhead
   - Larger chunks = less parallelism but better context

2. **Concurrency**: Match your system resources
   - More concurrent chunks = faster processing but more memory
   - Fewer concurrent chunks = slower but more stable

3. **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts
   - Too short = unnecessary failures
   - Too long = slow error detection

### Monitoring

1. **Track Success Rates**: Monitor chunk processing success
2. **Monitor Performance**: Watch processing times and resource usage
3. **Log Analysis**: Review logs for optimization opportunities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Failure Rate**: Reduce concurrency or increase timeouts
2. **Slow Processing**: Increase concurrency or reduce chunk sizes
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce concurrency or chunk sizes
4. **Poor Aggregation**: Check aggregator model and temperature

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```javascript
const orchestrator = new AgentOrchestrator({
  // ... other config
  debug: true,
  logLevel: 'verbose'
});
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Dynamic Chunking**: Adjust chunk sizes based on repository characteristics
2. **Intelligent Retry**: Smart retry strategies based on failure types
3. **Caching**: Cache chunk results for repeated analysis
4. **Streaming**: Stream results as chunks complete
5. **Load Balancing**: Distribute chunks across multiple workers

### Advanced Orchestration

1. **Dependency-Aware Processing**: Process chunks based on dependencies
2. **Priority Queues**: Process high-priority chunks first
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Dynamic concurrency adjustment
4. **Quality Metrics**: Automatic quality assessment and optimization

## Migration Guide

### From Single-Agent to Chunking

The chunking system is fully backward compatible:

1. **No Code Changes**: Existing code continues to work
2. **Automatic Detection**: System automatically uses chunking for large repos
3. **Enhanced Results**: Get richer analysis data automatically
4. **Configuration**: Optional configuration for fine-tuning

### Gradual Adoption

1. **Start with Defaults**: Use default configuration initially
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track processing times and success rates
3. **Tune Configuration**: Adjust based on your specific needs
4. **Scale Up**: Increase limits as needed for larger repositories

The chunking system represents a significant advancement in repository analysis capabilities, enabling efficient processing of repositories of any size while maintaining high-quality architectural insights.
